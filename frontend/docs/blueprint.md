# **App Name**: VOLTAROS

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Experiment Suggestions: Use Gemini tool for intelligent suggestions for chaos experiments based on historical data and system behavior, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Real-Time Experiment Dashboard: Visualize real-time metrics, experiment progress, and anomaly detection results, making it easy to monitor and interpret system behavior during chaos experiments.
- Automated Experiment Workflows: Enable users to define and automate complex chaos experiments with a drag-and-drop interface. Define the sequence, timing, and parameters for each failure injection.
- Google Cloud Integration: Provide integrations with GKE, Cloud Run, BigQuery, and Vertex AI to seamlessly orchestrate chaos experiments and leverage cloud-native capabilities.
- Automated Recovery Actions: Automate recovery actions based on detected anomalies, such as scaling pods, rerouting traffic, and rolling back deployments, minimizing the impact of failures.
- Automated Report Generation: Automatically generate human-readable reports and visualizations summarizing experiment outcomes, system resilience, and areas for improvement.
- Tabbed Interface for Actions: Use a tabbed interface for separate actions of the chaos engineering platform, such as running tests and automating them, for ease of navigation.
